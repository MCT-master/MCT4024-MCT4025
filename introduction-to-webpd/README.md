# Introduction to WebPD

In these two workshops, you will learn how to integrate Pure Data audio systems into web applications using WebPD. The sessions will cover basic web development principles, like Javascript, CSS, HTML, and the Document Object Model (DOM) before we set up local development environments and use WebPD to build browser-based audio web applications.

The goal is to learn more about how to set up and configure advanced technologies for synchronous and asynchronous online musical collaboration.
In class, we will explore examples together, with increasing complexity, that demonstrate how we can start to build complex audio DSP web apps using WebPD. With each example, several acitivities follow.

**NB!** This workshop requires an intermediate level of familiarity with Pure Data and the DOM-model.
