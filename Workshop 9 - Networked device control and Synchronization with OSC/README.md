# Networked Device Control and Synchronization With OSC

Today's will continue our exploration of synchronous online musical collaboration. The students will learn how we can use OSC to control audio parameters in a networked contexts using Pure Data and Python.

The goal is to learn more about how to set up and configure advanced techologies for networked music systems and synchronous online musical collaboration.
