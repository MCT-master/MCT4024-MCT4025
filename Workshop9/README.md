# Networked Device Control and Synchronization With OSC

Today, we will continue to explore synchronous online musical collaboration, this time through code. The students will learn how to use OSC timetags to synchronize and control audio in networked contexts, using Pure Data and Python.

The goal is to learn more about how to set up and configure advanced technologies for networked music systems and synchronous online musical collaboration.

# Dependencies

- In Python:

```
pip install playsound==1.2.2
pip install python-osc
```

- In Pure Data, install the [mrpeach](https://github.com/pd-externals/mrpeach) library from the "Find Externals".

# Workshop Activities

The repo has 3 examples, each consisting of a PD and Python file. The examples show how we can start building complex OSC audio communication systems that use timetags to mitigate latency and achieve higher precision. In class, we will go through each example together and do some activities to explore our possibilities.
