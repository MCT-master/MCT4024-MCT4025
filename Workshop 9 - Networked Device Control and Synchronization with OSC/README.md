# Networked Device Control and Synchronization With OSC

Today, we will continue to explore synchronous online musical collaboration, this time through code. The students will learn how to use OSC to synchronize and control audio parameters in a networked music contexts using Pure Data and Python.

The goal is to learn more about how to set up and configure advanced techologies for networked music systems and synchronous online musical collaboration.

# Dependencies

- In python:

```
pip install playsound==1.2.2
pip install python-osc
```

- In Pure Data, install the [mrpeach](https://github.com/pd-externals/mrpeach) library from the "Find Externals".

# Workshop Activities

In the repo, there are 3 examples of how we can network OSC between Python and Pure Data.

leading up to the final workshop activity. All examples network OSC between Python and Pure Data files using localhost. Let's start with example 1.

### Example 1 - Connection (from pd to py to pd)
